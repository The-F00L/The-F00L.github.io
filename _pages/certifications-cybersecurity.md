# üîí Security & Hacking Adventures

Welcome to my cybersecurity journey - where "just one more challenge" turned into an obsession with understanding how things break (so we can build them better).

  <div>
    <h3>TryHackMe SOC Level 1</h3>
    <p><strong>The breakthrough moment:</strong> This was where defensive security finally clicked for me. Learning to think like both attacker and defender simultaneously was like seeing the matrix for the first time.</p>
    <p><em>Real skills gained: Incident response, log analysis, threat hunting, SIEM mastery</em></p>

  <div>
    <h3>NahamCon 2021 CTF</h3>
    <p><strong>CTF baptism by fire:</strong> My first NahamCon, tackled solo. Learned that CTFs are less about winning and more about discovering how much you can learn when it's just you versus the challenge.</p>

## The Pattern Emerges üìà

Looking back at this collection, I can see my evolution from curious beginner to someone who genuinely understands that security isn't just about tools - it's about thinking differently about every system, every connection, every line of code.

The CTF competitions taught me speed and creativity. The learning paths gave me structure and depth. The Advent challenges showed me that even holiday traditions can be educational *(and slightly obsessive)*.
