# 🔒 Security & Hacking Adventures

Welcome to my cybersecurity journey - where "just one more challenge" turned into an obsession with understanding how things break (so we can build them better).

  <div>
    <h3>TryHackMe SAL1 (Security Analyst Level 1)</h3>
    <p><strong>Defensive thinking unlocked:</strong> SAL1 was the point where blue-team work stopped being abstract and started making sense. Instead of “alerts on a screen,” it became about context, investigation and decision-making. Less theory, more realism — and a strong reminder that good defense requires understanding how attackers actually operate.</p>
    <p><em>Skills that stuck: Alert triage, incident investigation, attacker-minded defense</em></p>

  <div>
    <h3>Advent of Cyber</h3>
    <p><strong>The December tradition:</strong> What started as “one challenge a day” quietly turned into a yearly ritual. Advent of Cyber proved that learning security doesn’t need perfect conditions — just curiosity and consistency. Every December added new layers: from basic fundamentals to malware, cloud missteps and defensive thinking. Same calendar, deeper understanding each year.</p>
    <p><em>Holiday habit: Advent of Cyber, every December</em></p>

  <div>
    <h3>TryHackMe SOC Level 1</h3>
    <p><strong>The breakthrough moment:</strong> This was where defensive security finally clicked for me. Learning to think like both attacker and defender simultaneously was like seeing the matrix for the first time.</p>
    <p><em>Real skills gained: Incident response, log analysis, threat hunting, SIEM mastery</em></p>

  <div>
    <h3>Jr Penetration Tester</h3>
    <p><strong>Why this mattered:</strong> My first serious dive into ethical hacking. Each successful exploit felt like solving a puzzle where the reward was understanding a fundamental security flaw.</p>

  <div>
    <h3>NahamCon 2021 CTF</h3>
    <p><strong>CTF baptism by fire:</strong> My first NahamCon, tackled solo. Learned that CTFs are less about winning and more about discovering how much you can learn when it's just you versus the challenge.</p>
    <p><em>Solo foundation: OSINT techniques, forensics fundamentals, puzzle-solving persistence</em></p>
  </div>

## The Pattern Emerges 📈

Looking back at this collection, I can see my evolution from curious beginner to someone who genuinely understands that security isn't just about tools - it's about thinking differently about every system, every connection, every line of code.

The CTF competitions taught me speed and creativity. The learning paths gave me structure and depth. The Advent challenges showed me that even holiday traditions can be educational *(and slightly obsessive)*.
