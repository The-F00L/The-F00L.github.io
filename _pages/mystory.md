# The Journey from Turbo Pascal to Today

Hi! I'm Robert, and this is the story of how a curious kid discovering Turbo Pascal in 8th grade turned into someone who can't stop exploring the endless rabbit holes of technology.

## üöÄ Where It All Started

It was 8th grade when I first encountered **Turbo Pascal**. Something about writing code that actually *did* something clicked in a way that nothing else had. That moment of watching your first program compile and run successfully? Pure magic. I was hooked.

That early spark led me down a path I'm still traveling - from high school vocational education in Information Technology to a specialized software development program, and eventually into the fascinating world of cybersecurity education.

## üéì The Learning Foundation

### Software Developer Certification Program

After completing my IT foundation, I dove deeper into software development. This wasn't just about learning more programming languages - it was about understanding how to think systematically about solving problems with code.

### Information Technology Vocational High School

Four years of building a solid technical foundation - from basic computer systems to network administration, programming fundamentals, and everything in between. This is where the Turbo Pascal curiosity evolved into genuine technical competency.

The Hungarian vocational education system gave me something invaluable: hands-on, practical experience alongside theoretical knowledge. It's an approach that still influences how I learn today.

## üíº The Professional Evolution

### Content Development Team Lead
**Avatao** | *September 2022 - Present*

Leading a team that creates cybersecurity education content while also developing backend solutions for our platform has taught me something fascinating: the best way to truly understand something is to figure out how to teach it to someone else.

**What I actually do:**
- Guide a team of content developers who turn complex technical concepts into engaging learning experiences
- Create cybersecurity education content that bridges theory and practical application
- Develop backend solutions and platform features that enhance the learning experience
- Build systems that can scale educational content delivery efficiently
- Learn constantly from both my team and the learners using our platform

### Content Developer
**Avatao** | *May 2022 - September 2022*

Where I discovered that creating educational content is its own unique skill set. You can understand technology deeply, but translating that knowledge into something that actually helps people learn? That's a completely different challenge.

This role taught me to think about learning from the learner's perspective - which completely changed how I approach my own certification journey.

## üß≠ My Learning Philosophy

Working in technology education has given me a unique perspective on learning itself. I see how people struggle with complex technical concepts, and I understand what makes the difference between content that teaches and content that just... exists.

**Why I'm Obsessed with Certifications:**

**Learning by Doing**: Theoretical knowledge is fine, but I gravitate toward certifications that make me actually *use* what I'm learning. Hands-on coding challenges, practical system administration, cloud labs, security scenarios - that's where real understanding happens.

**Curiosity Over Career Planning**: I don't pursue certifications because someone told me they're "good for my career." I pursue them because I'm genuinely curious about how things work, how they break, and how they can be built better.

**Teaching Through Learning**: Every skill I develop potentially becomes something I can help others understand. My certification journey isn't just personal development - it's R&D for better educational content.

**Building a Versatile Foundation**: Whether I'm developing software, engineering security solutions, or creating educational content, the core problem-solving skills transfer across domains. Each certification adds another tool to my toolkit.

## üéØ What Actually Drives Me

Here's the honest truth: I'm addicted to that moment when something complex finally makes sense. Whether it's understanding how a particular algorithm works, figuring out why a system behaves unexpectedly, building a more elegant solution to a problem, or discovering how different technologies can work together.

The fact that this journey started with Turbo Pascal in 8th grade and has led to working across development, security, and education? That's the kind of unpredictable path that happens when you follow genuine curiosity instead of just career advice.

Whether my future leads toward software development, security engineering, or somewhere I haven't even discovered yet, the foundation of continuous learning and problem-solving remains the same.

## ü§ù Let's Connect

I love connecting with fellow learning addicts, whether you're just starting your journey or you're someone who's been exploring technology longer than I've been alive. If you want to discuss the latest tech trends, share learning experiences, or just geek out about technology and development, I'm always up for a conversation.
